Core OOP + Language Basics
Classes & Objects – Build small domain models (like the e-commerce example earlier).

Inheritance & Interfaces – Create common contracts and multiple implementations.

Polymorphism – Practice calling the same method on different objects.

Encapsulation – Use private fields + getters/setters with validation.

Abstract Classes vs Interfaces – When to use each.

Overloading & Overriding – Write methods with different signatures and behavior.

Collections & Data Structures
List, Set, Map – Practice insertion, searching, sorting.
